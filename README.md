# Poly Variants

Poly Variants is a Rust library for working with polymorphic variants, providing efficient and type-safe operations over complex enum structures. This library is aimed at developers needing flexibility and extensibility in their data structures without sacrificing safety.

## Features

- Type-safe polymorphic variants: Build and manage polymorphic data structures efficiently.
- Flexible: Allows variants to evolve over time without losing type safety.
- Extensible: Easily add new variants to existing structures.
- Optimized for performance: Designed with efficiency in mind for production use.

## Installation

Add poly_variants to your Cargo.toml dependencies:

```
[dependencies]
poly_variants = "0.1.0"

Then, in your main.rs or lib.rs, include it with:


extern crate poly_variants;

Usage

Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use Poly Variants in your Rust project:

rust

use poly_variants::PolyVariant;

#[derive(Debug)]
enum MyVariant {
    Int(i32),
    Float(f64),
    Text(String),
}

fn main() {
    let int_variant = MyVariant::Int(42);
    let float_variant = MyVariant::Float(3.14);
    let text_variant = MyVariant::Text(String::from("Hello"));

    println!("{:?}", int_variant);
    println!("{:?}", float_variant);
    println!("{:?}", text_variant);
}

Advanced Usage

The library supports advanced use cases such as:

    Combining multiple variants into one structure
    Handling unknown variants gracefully
